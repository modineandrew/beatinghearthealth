Checklists are amazing tools to help you know what to get done. We have a health checklist here for you to track what you need to do for your health.
You can write down anything in here, and it will be here for you next time you come to the page.

Some good things to write down are:
* Goals for your health (keep your goals measureable and time-bound)
* Activities to help you improve your health

You can also use this as a general to-do list if you so desire.
