Beating Heart Health, our submission to the Congressional App Challenge

## What is it?
Beating Heart Health is a web-based health app to help you know how much sleep you need, gives you some good compliments, and plays high-quality Lo-Fi music.

## Why did we make it?
We heard about the Congressional App Challenge and figured we could make a pretty good app, so we did. Well, we've tried. And we think we've done pretty well.

## How did we make it?
This app is an entirely static, browser-based app written entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The entire app was developed in less than two weeks.

## Where do I find a web version of this?
https://beatingheart.servrco.com/

## Can I contribute?
Absolutely. During the month of November, however, no contributions will be published, as that is the judging period for the Congressional App Challenge.

### Thank you for reading!
