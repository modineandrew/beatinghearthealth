            <br>Beating Heart Health was designed to help people like yourself get info on what you need to live healthily.
        <br><br>We also made this as part of a competetion for the Congressional App Challenge. We all contributed to the app development.
        <br><br>Tyler (aka. Me to the left) did the writing and research, Torin (the one in the middle) helped with a little bit of everything, and finally Andrew (on the right) wrote the code for the app.
