        <p class="text" style="text-align: center;">Beating Heart Health is a web-based health app to help you know how much sleep you need, gives you some good compliments, and plays high-quality Lo-Fi music.
        <br><br>This app was written for the Congressional App Challenge, and due to time and resource restrictions, is not as fully featured as we thought it would become, but it is open source!
        <br><br>This project would not have been possible without a few key contributors. Thank you so much to every single person that helped us with this project, for anything from helping with the design to anything as small as giving a little bit of feedback.
        <br><br>Anyways, enjoy the app!
